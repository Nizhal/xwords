This file contains notes for setting up a remote repo that can be
built with fdroid. Which I use to produce builds from their system so
that I can test before release. Their builds are ... special.

To set up a repo against which
# git clone --recurse-submodules http://eehouse.org/xwords4.git" 
will work

First, ssh to eehouse.org and cd to /var/www/html/gitrepos, then
# sudo apt install fcgiwrap
# mkdir xwords4.git
# cd xwords4.git
# git init --bare

Then, locally (inside this repo):
# git remote add eehouse-public	ssh://eehouse.org/var/www/html/gitrepos/xwords4.git
and
# git push --tags -u eehouse-public main

And then, back on eehouse.org:
# cd /var/www/html/gitrepos/xwords4.git
# git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/main

And of course, the file git-site in this directory needs to be
installed. Right now it conflicts with other server blocks using the
same server_name; I need to fix that somehow.
