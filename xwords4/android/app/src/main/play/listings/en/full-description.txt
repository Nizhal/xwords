A cross-platform game with the same rules as Scrabble that can be
played locally (on the same device), or against up to three other
devices (per game) via data-SMS, Bluetooth and the internet.  Start
games via an invitation sent by email, SMS, or Bluetooth, or if
somebody's nearby just touch NFC-capable devices or have them scan a
QR Code.

Drag letters onto the board next to other letters to make new words;
press the number on the right of the screen to commit your move and
let the next person move. An English wordlist is built-in, and if the
app is running on a phone in a supported language other than English
it will offer to download a wordlist.

The source code supports push messaging via Google Play, but that
won’t function in this build even if Google Play is installed. It just
means that moves won’t be transmitted quite as quickly as if it were
supported. Play via SMS or Bluetooth is unaffected by this.
