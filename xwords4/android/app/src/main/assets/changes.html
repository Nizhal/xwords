  <h2>CrossWords 4.4.161 release</h2>

  <p>This minor release removes an under-construction image I added
      recently. It made friends think they were being hacked.</p>

  <div id="survey">
	<p>Please <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/GX3XLHR">take
	this survey</a> to help determine what gets done next in
	CrossWords.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>New with this release</h3>
  <ul>
      <li>Remove under-construction image that flashed by as a thumbnail was loading</li>
      <li>Make color of line separating board tiles configurable</li>
      <li>Change how dialogs are handled internally. You should NOT notice!</li>
  </ul>

  <p>(The full changelog
  is <a href="http://xwords.sf.net/and_changes.php">here</a>.)</p>

  <h3>Coming soon</h3>
  <ul>
      <li>Add filtering to the wordlist browser</li>
      <li>Improve move-via-NFC</li>
      <li>Support duplicate-style play (popular in France)</li>
      <li>Improve play-by-data-sms workaround
          using <a href="https://github.com/eehouse/nbsproxy">NBSProxy</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Please let me know
     (email <a href="mailto:xwords@eehouse.org">xwords@eehouse.org</a>)
     what&apos;s broken and what features you&apos;d most like to
     see. And if you do get a crash, please let your device report it
     to Google so I can see it!</p>

  <p>Thanks!<br>--Eric</p>
