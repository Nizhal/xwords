LANGINFO: <p>Spanish words include all letters in the English alphabet
LANGINFO: except "K" and "W", and with "Ã" added. Since there are no
LANGINFO: tiles for accented vowels, these are replaced by the
LANGINFO: unaccented forms.</p>


LANGINFO: <p>In addition, there are three special two-letter tiles
LANGINFO: "CH", "LL" and "RR".  The rules say that the corresponding
LANGINFO: two single tiles may not be used where a two-letter tile is
LANGINFO: possible (e.g. if a word contains "CH" you must use the "CH"
LANGINFO: tile rather than a "C" tile followed by an "H" tile.  Thus
LANGINFO: we remove all of these pairs from your wordlist and replace
LANGINFO: them with the appropriate two-letter "letter". </p>

# I think dealing with "specials" goes like this.  In the {} pairs
# below, if the first string is followed by other strings (one or two)
# they are assumed to be filenames.  The filenames will need to be
# found, and converted into binary files appropriate for the platform
# by rules given somewhere -- here?  No, since they're the same for
# all platforms.  Just put 'em in the byod.cgi file for now.

# It'll be assumed that the first name is for the "small" bitmap, and
# the second for the "large". It's ok for a file not to exist; it'll
# just be ignored.  In the unlikely case that you wanted to specify
# the large but not the small this is what you'd need to do.

# High bit means "official".  Next 7 bits are an enum where
# Spanish==6.  Low byte is padding
