LANGFILTER: tr -d '\r'
# tr seems to work on systems that don't know the Czech locale, but
# grep does not.  So don't use grep, e.g. to eliminate words
# containing letters not in our alphabet.  Instead, pass the -r flag
# via D2DARGS so they're dropped.
LANGFILTER: | sed -e 's/[[:lower:]]*/\U&/'
LANGFILTER: | sort -u

# presence of high-ascii means we must not pass -nosort
D2DARGS: -r -term 0 -enc UTF-8
#D2DARGS: -term 10 -r -enc UTF-8

LANGINFO: <p>This BYOD language works on Czech wordlists encoded in
LANGINFO: UTF-8 and produces dictionaries that should work on
LANGINFO: Unicode-aware systems. </p>

# High bit means "official".  Next 7 bits are an enum where
