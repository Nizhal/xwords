LANGINFO: <p>Polish is interesting because it has 32 letters plus a
LANGINFO: blank, a larger number than any other supported language.
LANGINFO: Yet while I call it "supported", in fact this combination
LANGINFO: has never been tested because I don't have a Polish
LANGINFO: wordlist.  So if you are the first and have problems you've
LANGINFO: probably found a bug.  Please let <a
LANGINFO: href="mailto:xwords@eehouse.org">me</a> know so that I can get
LANGINFO: this working.</p>

LANGINFO: <p>Note that the blank is the last tile here, while with all
LANGINFO: other languages it&apos;s the first.</p>

# LANGINFO: <p>Also, please note that we currently require the files you
# LANGINFO: upload to use the iso-8859-2 character encoding.</p>

# High bit means "official".  Next 7 bits are an enum where
# Polish==8.  Low byte is padding
