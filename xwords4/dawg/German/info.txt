LANGINFO: <p>German has the 26 English letters plus the three umlaut
LANGINFO: vowels.  Scharfes-s is not a legal tile, but if present in
LANGINFO: the wordlist submitted it'll be converted to "SS" by our
LANGINFO: filtering rules.  Additional filtering rules eliminate all
LANGINFO: words that don't contain at least one vowel and any that
LANGINFO: contain letters not found on tiles.</p>

# High bit means "official".  Next 7 bits are an enum where
